# Mental Health Widget

Mental health matters. It's a deeply important theme to me, and this widget is my small attempt to make mental wellness more accessible. I built it not as a product, but as a contributionâ€”something simple, embeddable, and useful.

Designed with care and TypeScript, it's lightweight enough for platforms like Tilda, yet thoughtfully structured for maintainability and future growth.

You can try it live here: [spontaneous-elf-fa52b7.netlify.app](https://spontaneous-elf-fa52b7.netlify.app)
